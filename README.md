This program multiplies the two numbers entered in the input file and prints the
result to the screen. then it converts these numbers and their products to the
decimal system and prints them back to the screen. The two multiplied numbers
can be infinitely long, so we should use a linked list when multiplying these
numbers. So we multiply two infinite numbers.
